Title: Discover the order of gene regulatory events during cell state transitions
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Elaine Yiqun CAO

Description: This package discovers the order of gene regulatory events during
    cell state transitions at single-cell resolution. It works on any single-cell
    trajectory or pseudo-time ordering of cells to discover the genes that act as 
    on/off switches between cell states and importantly the ordering at which these
    switches take place.
